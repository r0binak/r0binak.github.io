Hi! Here you can learn a little about me, as well as about my projects. I am 20 years old, I am a student from St. Petersburg. My hobby is reverse engineering, but in my repositories you will see more than just assembly or C code. I also often take part in CTF, there will be some writeups here. I'm studying **information security**, so there will be a lot of interesting things here.

My developments:

*   [ASM-labs](https://github.com/r0binak/ASM-labs/) (integer calculations, working with vectors, binary tree operations)
*   [Crypto-labs](https://github.com/r0binak/Crypto-labs) (symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods)
